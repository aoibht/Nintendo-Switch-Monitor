Pandemic Programming 2020.

Nintendo Switch's have become particularly difficult to buy at retail price ($300). Caused by the Covid-19 Pandemic, a demand spike for home entertainment systems has emerged the past couple of months. This lead to companies (Target, Walmart, Gamestop, etc) who are selling this item at its retail price, to quickly run out of stock. While companies that allow price gauging (Amazon, Ebay) have Switch's in stock, they are charging ~$200 premium. Yuck. 

Luckily, Target does allow you to order online. Instead, everyday they restock a few Nintendo Switchs at various locations in New York. 

This program checks the target website to see if the Switch is in stock. If it is, then it sends an email to my Brother and I, linking to the URL of the switch. 

I wrote this program in only a few minutes!
