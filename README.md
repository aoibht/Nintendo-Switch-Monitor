Pandemic Programming 2020.

Caused by the Covid-19 Pandemic, a demand spike for home entertainment systems has emerged the past couple of months. Particularly, Nintendo Switch's have become difficult to buy at retail price ($300). This lead to companies (Target, Walmart, Gamestop, etc) selling the item at retail price, to quickly run out of stock. While companies allowing price gauging (Amazon, Ebay) have Switch's in stock, they charge ~$200 premium. Yuck. 

Luckily, Target does allow you to order online. Instead, everyday they restock a few Nintendo Switchs at various locations in New York. 

This program checks the target website to see if the Switch is in stock. If it is, then it sends an email to me and my bbrother, linking to the URL of the switch. 

I wrote this program in only a few minutes! 

Thank you to https://realpython.com/python-send-email/ for demonstrating how to use the smtplib package. 

We got our Switch after two days!
